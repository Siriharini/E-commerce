## üì¶ How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd SmartSphere
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

2.  **Create an `images` folder:**
    In the root directory of the project (where `commerce.html`, `commerce.css`, and `commerce.js` are located), create a new folder named `images`.

3.  **Add your product images:**
    Place your product image files into the newly created `images` folder. Ensure the filenames exactly match those specified in `commerce.js` (e.g., `Premium Wireless Earbuds.jpg`, `Laptop.jpg`, etc.). Pay attention to capitalization and file extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, etc.).

4.  **Open `commerce.html`:**
    Simply open the `commerce.html` file in your preferred web browser. No local server is required for this front-end only project.

##  Customizing Product Images

The product data, including image paths, is defined in `commerce.js`. To use your own images:

1.  **Open `commerce.js`**.
2.  Locate the `products` array.
3.  For each product object, update the `image` property with the correct path to your image file within the `images` folder.
    Example: `image: "images/your-custom-image-name.jpg"`
